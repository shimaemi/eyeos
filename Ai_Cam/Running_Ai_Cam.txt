--model /usr/share/imx500-models/imx500_network_ssd_mobilenetv2_fpnli
This specifies the model file to use for object detection.
/usr/share/imx500-models/ is a directory where pre-trained AI models for the IMX500 camera are stored.
imx500_network_ssd_mobilenetv2_fpnli is the model being used. Let's break this down:
SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector): A deep-learning-based object detection model that can identify objects in an image.
MobileNetV2: A lightweight neural network optimized for edge devices, making it suitable for your Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W.
FPN (Feature Pyramid Network): Enhances detection accuracy across different object sizes.
LI (Likely means Low-Intensity or Lightweight, optimized for low-power devices like Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W).
